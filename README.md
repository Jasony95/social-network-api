# Social Network API

## Description

- My motivation is to create a API system that can use CRUD for an API of users with thoughts, friends, and reactions.
- I build this project to expand the social network platforms.
- It solves the problem of having to use API to construct a basic social network platform.
- I learned that MONGODB has id that are hard to identify than MySQL.
